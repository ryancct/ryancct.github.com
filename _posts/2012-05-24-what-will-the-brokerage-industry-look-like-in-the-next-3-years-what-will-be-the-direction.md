Given the ever-changing development in the securities market, the prediction about the outlook of the brokerage industry in the next three years will be hardly accurate. But, in response to the recent technological and economical situations, certain changes are likely to be made among all the brokerage firms in Hong Kong. I will discuss two of them that their impact on the industry is recognized as direct and far-reaching.

First, the potential for attack by cyber criminal will become greater when the technology is being more advanced. On 10 April 2011, HKEx site for disclosing company information was crashed due to the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack by computer hackers. Several blue-chip stocks such as HSBC and Cathay Pacific were suspended as they attempted to disclose price sensitive information. The hacking incident disrupted normal operations of trading in the market which might cause tremendous amount of money loss to the customers. It would be certain that high cyber-security awareness in the brokerage industry will be raised in the near future as no brokerage firm can run the risk of being too vulnerable to the hacker attack like the one in HKEx. Staff in brokerage firm should be mindful that information risk in the future is getting higher and learn the best practices for prevention of any cyber crimes in the financial market.

Second, more RMB securities products will be launched to follow the trend in RMB internationalization. The RMB deposits in HK have increased dramatically over the past few years. This is not only a driving engine to accelerate the RMB internationalization process, but also a significant proof that the demand for investment alternatives in RMB is huge provided the economic outlook of China is promising in the long term. The first IPO Hui Xian REIT (87001) went public in April last year and the Heng Seng RMB Gold ETF (83168) got listed in SEHK at the start of this year. My confidence is strong that more RMB securities products will be coming. However, RMB is not the local currency in HK and the exchange rate between RMB and HKD is not linked. Given the risks and costs involved in trading these products for the customers, HK brokerage firms should take caution when preparing for trading and clearing of RMB securities products to ensure that bad things wonï¿½t happen.

New risks keep coming in during the evolution of the financial markets. From technological advancement to RMB internationalization process, there is no one-way direction the brokerage industry should be heading to. To stay competitive in this market, brokerage firms should keep their mind open while at the same time be skeptical to any risks that might be introduced when moving beyond their existing boundary.
