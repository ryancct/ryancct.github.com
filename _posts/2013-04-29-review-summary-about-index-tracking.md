Index tracking aims to replicate the returns of a given index as closely as possible, by trading in various investment products.

This passive investment style is getting popular because, given that company research is not required and the target index composition is known, the total expense ratio (TER) is always lower compared to the active managed fund. Meanwhile, the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) emphasized that equilibrium market prices fully reflect all available info, so nothing can be done to systematically beat the market through active management. The index that represents the market is already the best strategy that investors should choose. In addition, Burton G Malkiel (2003) concluded in his paper that investors are likely to achieve for higher returns by employing a passive indexing strategy that they are likely to achieve from active portfolio management.

To perform index tracking, there are several replication strategies which can be adopted. They are full replication, optimization, stratified sampling, synthetic approach and Blended/Pragmatic approach. Among which, the full replication and optimization are very common. The performance of these replication strategies is determined by tracking error (TE) in finance. It is a measure of how closely a portfolio follows the index to which it is benchmarked. The methods of calculating the TE varies, but the most common one is called root mean square (RMS) of the active returns as shown below:
