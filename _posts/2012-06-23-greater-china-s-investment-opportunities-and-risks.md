Recent key economic indicators such as GDP, PPI & CPI showed signs that the Chinese
economy is slowing down. IMF further confirmed that, in light of the central government
policies that aim to sustain stable economic growth, China may be "heading for a soft
landing". However, amid this growing concern, the computer giant leader Michael Dell
remains upbeat of China as its decelerating economic growth still outpaces that of most
countries. In fact, it is that entrepreneurial belief that kept the global investment capital
flowing into China over the last decade. As this huge influx of money indicated that
China is a place for foreign investment, it is interesting to understand more about its
environment, especially the opportunities and risks behind it.

The rise of China's middle class

Author of The Chinese Dream, Helen Wang, claimed that Chinese middle class may
grow to 700 to 800 million, which is 50% to 60% of China's entire population. This
expanding group of middle class strives for a better standard of living. The desire for a
better standard of living leads to greater demand for consumer products. This situation is
similar to the post world war II baby boom in the United States. As many scholars stated,
Baby booms usually signify periods of general economic growth and stability. But in
China there are some differences compared to the United States, the shortage of quality
consumer goods at affordable prices is both creating a risk of Chinese being harmed by
defective, tainted or substandard products and creating good business opportunities for
enterprising Chinese and business people around the world.

Frequent law and regulatory reforms in China

Despite the potential these opportunities present to investors and businesses these
opportunities do not come without any threats. Notwithstanding its rapid economic
growth, China is still a developing country in which the laws and regulations are not yet
fully developed. The policy framework has implemented striking changes in the recent
years. Such striking reforms in the Chinese laws and regulations created an unstable
business environment for foreign investors or entrepreneurs. Without professional
assistance it is easy for foreign businesses and investors to violate Chinese laws and
regulations. Good examples are the Rio Tinto bribe case and the Google anti-censorship
issue. This poses risk of financial loss and reputational damage to good companies,
resulting in higher cost of compliance. Companies therefore need to tread carefully and
make extra effort to ensure that they are compliant with Chinese law to successfully enter
and thrive in the Chinese market.

Regardless of the investors' insight into China prospects, this large yet intricate, delicate
and strange consumer market has already drawn global attention and no single answer
without yielding to over-simplification can direct anyone to successful entry of this
Chinese market. I believe that above-mentioned factors are only some that explained
external investment environment in China, while internal factors such as firm strategies
regarding mode of entry or firm size also play an equally important role in making
investment decision in China as well. So, investors should take a holistic approach to
evaluate the risk & return of any projects that target the China market.
